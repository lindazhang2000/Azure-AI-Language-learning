Azure AI's Speech service offers an interactive language learning feature that provides real-time pronunciation assessment to enhance language acquisition. This tool delivers immediate feedback on various aspects of speech, including:

Accuracy: Evaluates how closely your pronunciation matches that of a native speaker.

Fluency: Assesses the natural flow of your speech, focusing on the use of pauses between words.

Prosody: Analyzes elements like stress, intonation, speaking speed, and rhythm to determine the naturalness of your speech.

Grammar: Reviews the correctness and diversity of your sentence structures.

Vocabulary: Evaluates your effective use of words and their appropriateness within the given context.

To begin using this feature, navigate to the Language learning section in the Speech Studio. You can select a scenario, engage in conversations with a GPT-powered voice assistant, and receive detailed assessment reports that highlight areas for improvement. This interactive approach aims to make language learning more engaging and effective by providing personalized feedback to help you refine your speaking skills.

For developers interested in integrating this functionality into their applications, Azure provides a Pronunciation Assessment API through the Speech SDK. This API enables the evaluation of speech pronunciation, offering feedback on accuracy, fluency, and other critical aspects, thereby facilitating the development of applications that support language learners in improving their pronunciation skills.

It's important to note that the language learning feature currently supports only en-US. For the most up-to-date information on supported languages and regions, refer to the official documentation.
